# Installation
These are the instructions for setting up the countdown for SPL-OBS.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
1. TOC
{:toc}

## Download the files
Download the latest release from the releases page on GitHub:

[Download](https://github.com/oofdere/SPL-OBS/releases){: .btn .btn-green }

## Unzip to a folder
Make a new folder in an easily accessible location, as this is where the program files will be stored. You can call it whatever you want, but a name like `SPL-OBS` would probably be easier to find later than, say, `New Folder (18374)`.

Then, extract the contents of the file you downloaded into the folder.

It should now look something like this:

ADD AN IMAGE
{: .label .label-red }

## Point StationPlaylist to the output
Not yet documented
{: .label .label-yellow }
