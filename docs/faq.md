### Is this stable?
It works on my machine.

### What is the default websockets login?
 - Host: `localhost`
 - Port: `4444`
 - Password: `spl-obs`
This can **(and probably should) be changed** by modifying the updater and countdown's configuration files.

### Is this cross-platform?
No, partly because StationPlaylist Studio only runs on Windows so no other testing has been done.
 - Requires GDI+ text sources. Easy fix, but not cross-platform out of the box.
 - Binary (.exe) obviously is not.

### Why are the updater and countdown seperate?
Development is easier this way, and the countdown is the only "real-time"/time-sensitive component. Originally it was one script but it was unwieldy and the countdown was always off.

Also, I plan to split off the countdown into its own package at some point.

### Should I let you know if I'm using this or build off of it?
Please do! You are, of course, under no obligation to do so, but I'd be interested in seeing what's done with this, of course.
